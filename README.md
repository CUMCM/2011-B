CUMCM-2011 Problem B:

Setting and Scheduling of Traffic and Patrol Police Service Platforms

Some Traffic and Patrol Police Service Platforms (TPPSPs) have been settled at some traffic centers and key parts of an urban area of a city. All these TPPSPs are playing the roles of criminal and law enforcement, security administration, traffic management with almost the same police force. How to allocate and schedule TPPSPs is an important issue. 
Please develop mathematical models to study the following problems: 

(1) Figure 1 in Appendix 1 illustrates the transportation network and the locations of 20 TPPSPs in the city center District A, and the detailed data are given in Appendix 2. Please allocate the jurisdiction region for every TPPSP such that the police can arrive at the locale as quickly as possible, expected within 3 minutes (the speed of police vehicles is assumed to be 60km/h) after an emergent event happens.

When a major emergence happens, the 13 access arteries in District A have to be blockaded immediately. In practice, a TPPSP can only blockade an intersection. Please schedule the blockade scheme for the TPPSPs of District A.
According to the present situation that the workload of the TPPSPs of District A is unbalanced and the response time of some TPPSPs is too long, it is planned to add 2 to 5 TPPSPs in the district. Please determine the number and the locations of the TPPSPs to be added.

(2) Please investigate the reasonableness of the TPPSP setting for the whole city (see Appendix) which includes six main districts A, B, C, D, E, F. If it is unreasonable, please give your solution.
Assume there is a major criminal occurs at the location P (the 32th node), the suspects have run away by car, and the police receive the report three minutes later. Please develop an optimal containment strategy which schedules all TPPSPsâ€™ police force of the city to arrest the suspects as quickly as possible.
